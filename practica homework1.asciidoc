print("HELLO WORD")

HELLO WORD

----
In this firts program we´ll do a introduction book learn more phyton 3 the hard away and explain some exercises

del libro'']

= practice 0 ``the setup''

In this first practice we saw the types of programs that we can use the
libraries etc. besides how to install phyton on windows, macOS and linux

software]

= practice 1 ``A good firts program''

in this part we seen how we can print text on the program


+*In[8]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
print("this text will appear on the screen")
----


+*Out[8]:*+
----
this text will appear on the screen
----

= practice 2 ``Comments and Pound Characters''

To comment, you will follow as follows:


+*In[10]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
print("this text will appear on the screen")#but now you can write comments like a numbers or other things
#and this text wont appear on the screen
----


+*Out[10]:*+
----
this text will appear on the screen
----

= practice 3 ``Numbers and Math''

Here what we are seeing is how to do mathematical operations in
programming below I will leave some examples


+*In[18]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
print("80 * 50 =", 80*50)
print("70 / 4 =",70/4)
print("148524 % 16 =", 148524%16)
#for this to work you have to put a "," after a text so it can run.
----


+*Out[18]:*+
----
80 * 50 = 4000
70 / 4 = 17.5
148524 % 16 = 12
----

= practice 4 ``Variables and Names''

This is more than anything to give you a comment using the math in them
for example to make an operation that instead of writing a number is a
word, letter or symbol.


+*In[21]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
n = 200
c = 400 
s =45

print("we need", n ,"to complete" , c, " and my father will give me" , s ,"today")
----


+*Out[21]:*+
----
we need 200 to complete 400  and my father will give me 45 today
----

= practice 5 ``More Variables and Printing''

the chains are used and I know that you will wonder how it is used well
because it is very sensillo just see the following example and analyze.


+*In[33]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
m = 'cockies'
j = 'tacos'
r = 'guitar'
print(f"maria likes {m}.")
print(f"karla is eating {j} and her brother is playing {r}")
----


+*Out[33]:*+
----
maria likes cockies.
karla is eating tacos and her brother is playing guitar
----

= practice 6 ``Strings and Text''

Like the previous practice we will see what chains are more without
enbargo we will be using them in a more complex way


+*In[37]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
s = 8
sleep ='horas dormidas'
k= f"i don´t sleep {s} {sleep} in the morning"
print(k)

----


+*Out[37]:*+
----
i don´t sleep 8 horas dormidas in the morning
----

= practice 7 ``More Printing''

It’s time to practice and test what you learned so far


+*In[61]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
end1 = 'i'
end2 = 'n'
end3 = 'e'
end4 = 'd'
end5 = 'f'
end6 = 'o'

print(f"{end1}´m a person that") 
print(end2 + end3 + end3 + end4) 
print(end5 + end6 + end6 + end4)
----


+*Out[61]:*+
----
i´m a person that
need
food
----

= practice 8 ``Printing, Printing''




+*In[1]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
formatter = "{} {} {} {}"

print(formatter.format(1, 2, 3, 4))
print(formatter.format("one", "two", "three", "four"))
print(formatter.format(True, False, False, True))
print(formatter.format(formatter, formatter, formatter, formatter))
print(formatter.format(
"Try your",
"Own text here",
"Maybe a poem",
"Or a song about fear"
))
----


+*Out[1]:*+
----
1 2 3 4
one two three four
True False False True
{} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {}
Try your Own text here Maybe a poem Or a song about fear
----

= practice 9 ``Printing, Printing, Printing''

Everything goes slowly the only thing you should do is to focus on what
you learn


+*In[20]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
states = "san luis oaxaca tamaulipas nuevo leon"
country = "EUA\nMexico\nJAPAN\nCOLOMBIA\nFRANCE"

print("MEXICAN STATES : ", states)
print("SOME COUNTRIES: ", country)
----


+*Out[20]:*+
----
MEXICAN STATES :  san luis oaxaca tamaulipas nuevo leon
SOME COUNTRIES:  EUA
Mexico
JAPAN
COLOMBIA
FRANCE
----

= practice 10 ``What Was That?''

Now what we will do is try to make a program with double and triple
quotes for example ``Carlos'' is ``playing'' and what is special about
this is that the software is difficult to identify which of the texts
you are enclosing in quotes let’s see the following example.


+*In[21]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
tabby_cat = "\tI'm tabbed in."
persian_cat = "I'm split\non a line."
backslash_cat = "I'm \\ a \\ cat."

fat_cat = """
I'll do a list:
\t* Cat food
\t* Fishies
\t* Catnip\n\t* Grass
"""

print(tabby_cat)
print(persian_cat)
print(backslash_cat)
print(fat_cat)
----


+*Out[21]:*+
----
	I'm tabbed in.
I'm split
on a line.
I'm \ a \ cat.

I'll do a list:
	* Cat food
	* Fishies
	* Catnip
	* Grass
